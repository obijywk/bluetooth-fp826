<p>This is my #826 Fisher-Price tape recorder. Manufactured January 21, 1987 (as stamped in the battery compartment).</p>

<p>I used it constantly when I was a kid. When I found it again in 2015, it didn’t work anymore. The problem was probably just a broken or missing belt, which I could have replaced. Instead, I made some deeper changes - I <strong>converted it into a Bluetooth speaker</strong>.</p>

<p>The #826 tape recorder is quite easy to open up - just six screws on the back, and then the entire back slides right off.</p>

<p>There’s a 3” speaker mounted to the back of the case. I was hoping to re-use the speaker as-is, but measured it to have an impedance of 32Ω, which I thought might be a little high for the amplifier components designed for 8Ω speakers that I was planning on using. I stuck with the original speaker at first, though.</p>

<p>This is a closer view of most of the mechanical and electronic components, with the belt mechanism (visible in the previous image) already removed. There are a fair number of mechanical springs, plastic levers, etc. that are used to control the tape deck. I did not want to simply remove these, because I wanted to try to maintain the original feel of the buttons, and I thought keeping the springs intact would be the easiest way to do so.</p>

<p>There was a single PCB in a slot near the right side of the case. I did not intend to reuse any of its electronics. The interesting part here was the volume knob, which I did want to use - it was attached directly to a potentiometer on the PCB. I would either have to keep the potentiometer there and measure it digitally, or replace it with another sensor that fit the volume knob.</p>

<p>Almost all of the parts I used came from <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com">SparkFun</a>, an excellent source of easy-to-use and well-documented hobbyist electronics components.</p>

<p>The core of the project is a <a href="http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?product=RN52">Roving Networks RN-52 Bluetooth Audio module</a> (mounted to SparkFun’s <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12849">breakout board</a> for this module).</p>

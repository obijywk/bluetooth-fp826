{"name":"Bluetooth-fp826","tagline":"Bluetooth speaker mod for a Fisher Price #826 tape recorder","body":"![Case exterior](images/case_exterior.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis is my #826 Fisher-Price tape recorder. Manufactured January 21, 1987 (as stamped in the battery compartment).\r\n\r\nI used it constantly when I was a kid. When I found it again in 2015, it didn’t work anymore. The problem was probably just a broken or missing belt, which I could have replaced. Instead, I made some deeper changes - I converted it into a Bluetooth speaker.\r\n\r\n### A Look Inside\r\n\r\nThe #826 tape recorder is quite easy to open up - just six screws on the back, and then the entire back slides right off.\r\n\r\n![Case interior](images/case_interior_horizontal.jpg)\r\n\r\nThere’s a 3” speaker mounted to the back of the case. I was hoping to re-use the speaker as-is, but measured it to have an impedance of 32Ω, which I thought might be a little high for the amplifier components designed for 8Ω speakers that I was planning on using. I stuck with the original speaker at first, though.\r\n\r\n![Case interior closeup](images/case_interior_closeup.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis is a closer view of most of the mechanical and electronic components, with the belt mechanism (visible in the previous image) already removed. There are a fair number of mechanical springs, plastic levers, etc. that are used to control the tape deck. I did not want to simply remove these, because I wanted to try to maintain the original feel of the buttons, and I thought keeping the springs intact would be the easiest way to do so.\r\n\r\nThere was a single PCB in a slot near the side of the case. I did not intend to reuse any of its electronics. The interesting part here was the volume knob, which I did want to use - it was attached directly to a potentiometer on the PCB. I would either have to keep the potentiometer there and measure it digitally, or replace it with another sensor that fit the volume knob.\r\n\r\n### Components and Construction\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the parts I used came from [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com), an excellent source of easy-to-use and well-documented hobbyist electronics components.\r\n\r\nThe core of the project is a [Roving Networks RN-52 Bluetooth Audio module](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?product=RN52) (mounted to SparkFun’s [breakout board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12849) for this module).\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-65753681-1","note":"Don't delete this file!

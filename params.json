{"name":"Bluetooth-fp826","tagline":"Bluetooth speaker mod for a Fisher Price #826 tape recorder","body":"### A Look Inside\r\n\r\nThe #826 tape recorder is quite easy to open up - just six screws on the back, and then the back pops right off.\r\n\r\nThere’s a 3” speaker mounted to the back of the case. I was hoping to re-use the speaker as-is, but measured it to have an impedance of 32Ω, which I thought might be a little high for the amplifier components designed for 8Ω speakers that I was planning on using. I decided to give it a try anyway, though - I could always replace it later.\r\n\r\n### Components and Construction\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the parts I used came from [SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com), an excellent source of easy-to-use and well-documented hobbyist electronics components.\r\n\r\nThe core of the project is a [Roving Networks RN-52 Bluetooth Audio module](http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?product=RN52) (mounted to SparkFun’s [breakout board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12849) for this module).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
